Link to the web app: https://chatroomfun.herokuapp.com/

Brief Intro..

The application is hosted using the free services provided by Heroku
I am modififying it regularly until I am satisfied with its outlook and performance. Thanks for being patient.
The purpose of this web app is it show my skills in building a single page web application in nodejs using 
a framework like Express 

The web app is divided into 3 modules: Home, Speakers and About the speakers

On the home page you will see the general content of the Web page.
On the Speakers page you will see the list of all the speakers and the list of all the art works.

If you wish to know more about any of the artist then click on any of them and it shall take you to the page
that will show entire details about the artist and only the artwork related to that artist.

"Love javascript!"
I shall continue to explore more of node and javascript!

Happy browsing!
